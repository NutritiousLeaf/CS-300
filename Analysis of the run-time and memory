In this section, we analyze and compare the performance of reading and inserting data based on the provided pseudocode in earlier steps. We ignore the menu and display operations and focus on the primary operations: opening and reading the file, parsing each line, creating course objects, and inserting the objects into the selected data structure. 

The vector is simple to implement and offers fast appending with constant time complexity O(1). It is also simple to iterate through and thus suitable for printing course details. Finding a specific course, on the other hand, takes linear time O(n), which is ineffective with growing dataset sizes. Also, since the vector does not maintain order, data must be sorted explicitly for Option 2 at an overhead of O(n log n). The worst drawback is that verifying prerequisites against the courses list can be O(n²) in the worst case. 

The hash table has a fast lookup, typically O(1) on average, making insertion and searching both efficient and fast. This makes it ideal for operations like checking if a prerequisite exists or searching for a given course. Hash tables, however, do not keep data in any inherent order, so printing the course list in alphabetical order involves pulling out all the values into a separate list and sorting it, adding complexity. They also use more memory due to internal hash bucketing data structures. 

The binary search tree (BST) provides the best of both worlds. It maintains course data in sorted order implicitly via in-order traversal, without the need for sorting. Both searching and insertions are quick, with an average time of O(log n), and prerequisite checking is faster than with a vector implementation, taking O(n log n) time. The primary disadvantage is that BSTs are slightly more complex to implement and can degrade to O(n) performance when the tree becomes unbalanced, but this is unlikely with varied input. 
Based on the runtime analysis and the behavior of each data structure, the binary search tree (BST) is the most appropriate for this program. 

The BST automatically keeps courses in alphanumeric order, making it ideal to print the whole course list (Option 2) without the need for sorting. Search and insertion are both fast with an average time complexity of O(log n). It also supports more efficient prerequisite checking compared to using the vector. The data structure has a good compromise between needing to be ordered output and having fast lookups, with the capacity to manage larger data sets. Overall, it meets the advisor’s requirements with clean, efficient, and scalable performance.
